## Afterwise

Afterwise offers a trustless platform specifically designed for transferring digital inheritances and safeguarding digital wealth. With Afterwise, users can securely deposit and invest their digital assets through the Afterwise Safe Vault. What sets Afterwise apart is its remarkable flexibility, allowing users to designate beneficiaries as desired, even including themselves.

There is a dead-man switch mechanism that the user can utilize to prove they still have access to their private key.
